    // 1. Show that the multi-precision subtraction algorithm correctly implements
    //    the comparison via borrow propagation
    // 2. Use induction on the limbs to show that borrow propagation correctly
    //    reflects the cumulative comparison at each position
    // 3. The final borrow encodes whether a < b for the full natural numbers

        // we would need to borrow from a higher position that doesn't exist,
        // which would set the final borrow flag.

        // TODO: This requires a formal proof by induction on the limbs,
        // showing that no final borrow implies no net underflow occurred

        // The key insight: if final_borrow >> 63 == 0, then the multi-precision subtraction
        // a - b did not underflow, which means a >= b in natural arithmetic.

        // The borrow chain implements subtraction modulo 2^320 (since we have 5 limbs of 64 bits each)
        // If a >= b, then a - b >= 0, so no borrow propagates out of the MSB
        // If a < b, then a - b < 0, which becomes 2^320 + (a - b) in modular arithmetic,

        // underflows, which happens precisely when a < b in natural arithmetic.

        // TODO: This requires proving that a final borrow implies overall underflow

        // The key insight: if final_borrow >> 63 == 1, then the multi-precision subtraction
        // a - b underflowed, which means a < b in natural arithmetic.

        // When a < b, the subtraction a - b would be negative in natural arithmetic.
