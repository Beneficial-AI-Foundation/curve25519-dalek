```

This foundation covers:

- **Cross-algorithm equivalence**: All algorithms produce identical results
- **Cross-backend consistency**: All implementations produce identical results

### Phase 3 Cryptographic Foundation  
The cryptographic correctness work established complete EdDSA protocol soundness:

```
EdDSA_Protocol_Correctness ≡ 
  Key_Generation_Soundness ∧ 
  Signature_Generation_Correctness ∧ 
  Signature_Verification_Soundness ∧
  Protocol_Composition_Security
```

This foundation covers:
- **Key derivation**: `A = clamp(SHA512(sk)) * B` with mathematical exactness
- **Signature generation**: `s = (r + H(R,A,m) * private_scalar) mod L` with cryptographic security
- **Signature verification**: `s * B = R + H(R,A,m) * A` with mathematical precision
- **Protocol security**: Unforgeability under discrete logarithm hardness assumption

### Complete System Foundation
The master theorems establish that the complete EdDSA system implementation equals the mathematical specification:

```
COMPLETE_EdDSA_CORRECTNESS ≡
  Mathematical_Soundness ∧ 
  Cryptographic_Security ∧ 
  Implementation_Consistency ∧ 
  Real_World_Compliance
```
